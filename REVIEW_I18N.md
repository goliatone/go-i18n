# go-i18n Package Review

## Context
We are evaluating go-i18n for a multilingual content platform that relies on declarative locale configuration, opt-in fallback chains, and locale-aware formatting. Translators are wired into Go templates, and configuration flows must support both simple deployments (one locale, no fallbacks) and advanced setups (regional variants, plural-aware messaging).

## Strengths
- Translator contract (`Translate(locale, key string, args ...any)`) matches our integration surface, and the implementation works with metadata-aware hooks.
- Static store and JSON/YAML loaders provide immutable catalogs that can be shared safely across components.
- Template helper map and formatter registry allow registration of translation/formatting helpers and opt-in overrides.
- Decorator hooks enable logging/metrics without modifying the core translator.

## Gaps & Risks
- `SimpleTranslator.lookupLocales` always collapses locale parents (e.g., `en-US â†’ en`) and appends the default locale even when no fallback chain is configured (`translator.go:224-254`). Missing features: strict locale isolation for markets that require unique copy, the ability to opt out of parent fallbacks, and predictable error reporting when content is absent. Remediation: gate parent/default traversal behind configuration or expose a `DisableImplicitFallbacks` option so callers control the lookup order explicitly.
- `Config.seedResolverFallbacks` automatically injects parent fallbacks whenever pluralization is enabled (`config.go:212-258`). Missing features: deterministic fallback order that only includes what callers declare, and the ability to keep plural rules without altering fallback behavior. Remediation: separate plural-rule seeding from fallback seeding or add a toggle (e.g., `DisableAutoSeedFallbacks`) so pluralization can be enabled independently.
- Configuration surface only accepts locale codes. There is no helper such as `AddLocale` with functional options to capture display names, default/active flags, fallback chains, or custom metadata (`config.go:8-19`, `types.go:7-17`). Missing features: a canonical source for locale labels in UI, the ability to mark a default locale atomically with registration, and structured metadata for downstream services (routing, analytics, formatting). Remediation: expand the config API to register locales via structs/functional options and persist metadata alongside the translation store.
- Formatter helpers ignore the `locale` argument and emit English-centric output (ordinal suffixes, conjunctions, currency format) rather than locale-aware strings (`formatters.go:10-75`). Missing features: localized number/date patterns, locale-specific list/ordinal grammar, and currency/measurement formatting that respects separators and symbol placement. Remediation: integrate locale data (e.g., `golang.org/x/text` plus generated CLDR bundles) or provide per-locale formatter hooks with fixtures so helpers can be swapped without rewriting templates.
- `FormatPhone` is a passthrough stub, leaving phone-number formatting unimplemented (`formatters.go:64-65`).

## Planned Work Alignment
- `FORMATTERS_TDD.md` defines the formatter overhaul: hybrid `golang.org/x/text` + generated CLDR bundles, shared fallback resolver usage, eager provider registration for the default `en`/`es` set, an `el` example, and configuration-backed extensibility.
- `FORMATTERS_TSK.md` breaks that plan into tasks (provider promotion, registry upgrades, generator tooling, helper rewrites, locale fixtures/tests, documentation, benchmarks). Completing these items addresses the formatter-related risks above, including phone formatting.
- Translator fallback isolation, configuration metadata expansion, and resolver controls remain open items. A separate design (e.g., `TRANSLATOR_TDD.md`) should capture those requirements before implementation begins.

## Recommendations
1. Make locale fallbacks strictly opt-in: remove automatic parent/default resolution, or guard it behind explicit configuration flags.
2. Expand the configuration API to register locales with metadata and functional options so downstream systems can rely on a single source of truth.
3. Enhance formatter implementations (or integrate `golang.org/x/text`) so helpers respect locale conventions; document any interim limitations.
4. Implement phone-number formatting or expose an interface that allows applications to supply locale-specific formatting logic.
